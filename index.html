				<h1>Early life and background</h1>
				<p>Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand),[19] and he hails from a Hindu Rajput family.[20] His paternal village Lwali is in <br>the Lamgara block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand. Dhoni's parents moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi, where his father Pan Singh<br> worked in junior management positions in MECON. Dhoni has a sister Jayanti Gupta and a brother Narendra Singh Dhoni.Dhoni is a fan of<br> Adam Gilchrist, and his childhood idols were cricket teammate Sachin Tendulkar, Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan <br>and singer Lata Mangeshkar[23][24]

					Dhoni studied at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Shyamali, Ranchi, Jharkhand where he initially excelled<br> in badminton and football and was selected at district and club level in these sports. Dhoni was a goalkeeper for his football team and was <br>sent to play cricket for a local cricket club by his football coach. Though he had not played cricket, Dhoni impressed with his wicket-keeping <br>skills and became the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando cricket club (1995â€“1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was<br> picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship and he performed well.[22] Dhoni focused on cricket after<br> his 10th standard.[25] He was a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway station from 2001 to 2003, under South Eastern<br> Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal.[26][27][28] His colleagues remember him as a very honest, straightforward employee <br>of the Indian Railways. But Dhoni also had a mischievous side to his personality. Once, while staying at the railway quarters, Dhoni and a <br>couple of his friends covered themselves in white bedsheets and walked around in the complex late in the night. The night guards were<br> fooled into believing that there were ghosts moving around in the complex. The story made big news on the next day.[29][30][31]
